        <p class="text-muted" >The campus is outstanding! From the tall buildings to the beautiful sceneries, it is trully a school to visit. Near the first building, there is a bus lot where all the busses come and park for the kids to get to their classes. When we enter, we see a rock-climbing wall and a pond with a wooden bridge over it which leads to the jungle jym or the playground. The primary building, which are grades KG to 3rd standard is a tall building with two floors. The entrance leads to the assembly hall, which is right in front of the reception desk, where you can register. On the first floor, we have the activity classes, such as ICT, Art, etc. with a teacher's room beside it. There is an indoor swimming pool for lower grades right beside the stairs which lead to another art room, 2nd and 3rd grade classes, music class, dance class, theatre class etc. When we go outside, we have a big soccer field with a few cricket nets, basketball court and a tennis court and finally a swimming pool. Here you can go for PE and other sports. On the other building, which is the higher grades building used for 4th to 12th grade and above, with two stairs, a dance room for higher grades and an art room for higher grades. The pathway between the two main buildings is beautiful filled with stones, flower and grass. Beside the path we have a field where children can do whatever they want, and behind that is the parking lot for cars. That's pretty much it of this amazing campus, and hope that you like it as well!
